# Dribble in the Mind: Exploring Causality with Cognitive Soccer Agents

This repository supports the study **"Dribble in the Mind: Exploring Causality with Cognitive Soccer Agents"**, a project investigating causal reasoning in robotic soccer simulations using a hybrid cognitive architecture. The simulation features a goalkeeper agent attempting to infer the motion of a ball and the intentions of a striker using only partial sensory information.

The code for the work **"Dribble in the Mind: Exploring Causality with Cognitive Soccer Agents"** is present in branch **nao**.

## Setup

Run first the scene present in **scenes** using CoppeliaSim_Edu_V4_3_0_Ubuntu20_04

Then run the java project  **CST_Causality_App**


## üß† Project Overview

The project demonstrates a hybrid cognitive architecture that fuses neural perception and symbolic reasoning, built using the **Cognitive Systems Toolkit (CST)** and tested in the **CoppeliaSim** simulation environment. Inspired by **Peircean abductive logic**, the system explores how artificial agents can construct internal models of causality to perform under uncertain and dynamic conditions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/causal_episode.png" alt="Cognitive architecture for causal inference in robotic soccer. Green modules represent sensorial components that capture raw spatial data (position, orientation, quaternion). Purple modules store perceptual histories of agents and objects. Blue modules are semantic learners ‚Äî linear classifiers trained to predict future positions of the ball and striker. White modules perform causal inference by interpreting predictions and triggering behavior habits. Arrows indicate the data flow and inference cycle within each episode." width="600"/>
</p>

The system consists of four main layers:

### 1. Sensorial Modules
- Interface with CoppeliaSim via RemoteAPI.
- Collect spatial data (position, orientation, rotation) from the ball, striker, and other agents.

### 2. Perceptual Modules
- Store recent histories (up to 100 frames) of observed objects.
- Enable temporal tracking for motion analysis.

### 3. Semantic Modules
- `Ball Learner` and `Striker Learner`: Linear Data Classifiers trained on historical trajectories.
- Predict future positions based on past movements and context.

### 4. Causal Module
- Aggregates semantic predictions into behavioral abstractions called **"habits"**.
- Infers causal relations to trigger proactive goalkeeper behaviors.

Each component utilizes CST's **idea representation**, a flexible symbolic structure supporting cognitive integration and reasoning.

## ü§ñ Agents and Simulation Setup

### Environment
- Based on RoboCup SPL specifications.
- Field dimensions: 9000mm x 6000mm.
- Simulated in **CoppeliaSim** with physics-based modeling.

<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/train.png" alt="Top-down view of the robotic soccer field configured to RoboCup SPL in Simulation environment with CoppeliaSim.  The scene includes two active teams, with NAO robots, a stationary ball at the center, and several passive players distributed randomly to simulate spatial obstacles. The red-headed agent in the left goal area is the striker and the yellow-headed agent in the right goal area is the active goalkeeper." width="600"/>
</p>

### Agents
- **Striker (NAO robot)**: Locates and kicks the ball.
- **Goalkeeper (NAO robot)**: Tracks the ball laterally and infers striker intent through semantic and causal modules.
- **Passive Players**: Randomly placed to simulate occlusions and increase spatial complexity.

## üß™ Methodology

### Training Phase
- Goalkeeper is trained in a fixed environment with variable agent positions.
- Physical parameters like ball size and field friction remain constant.
- Five agent instances trained independently for result consistency.

<p align="center">
<img src="imgs/train_plot.png" alt="Average error curves, with their standard deviations, between the position of the ball and the attacker and the predictions of the cognitive agent. The error averages are also presented. The averages were calculated based on the five instances used for training.  " width="600"/>
</p>

### Testing Phase
Three key environmental perturbations were introduced:

1. **Friction Change**  
   - Increased coefficient from 0.3 to 0.5.
   - Tested adaptation to altered field dynamics.

2. **Ball Property Change**  
   - Increased ball mass to 0.5 kg and radius to 20 cm.
   - Evaluated the robustness of physical modeling.

3. **Spatial Complexity Change**  
   - Increased number of passive players from 5 to 7 per team.
   - Tested generalization under occlusion and crowding.

## üìà Results

### Training Results
- Continuous error reduction observed for both striker and ball predictions.
- Ball predictions were more accurate due to deterministic dynamics.
- Striker trajectory exhibited more variance, reflecting higher model complexity.

### Testing Results

| Test Scenario               | Ball Prediction Accuracy | Striker Prediction Accuracy | Notes |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Baseline (training scene)  | High                      | High                         | Good generalization |
| Increased Friction         | Moderate                  | High                         | Overestimates ball range |
| Ball Property Variation    | High                      | High                         | Slight deviation on curves |
| More Passive Players       | High                      | High                         | Slight impact on ball turns |

- The system demonstrated **strong generalization** to novel conditions, particularly in handling agent-driven behaviors (striker).
- Performance decreased slightly for passive dynamics (ball) in changed friction environments.
